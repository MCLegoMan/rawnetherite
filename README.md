# Raw Netherite (Quilt)  
Modifies the process of obtaining Netherite.  

This mod adds a new item called **Chunk of Ancient Debris**. This item is dropped by Ancient Debris when mined. When mined with Fortune, there is a chance of more dropping, and when mined with Silk Touch, the Ancient Debris itself will drop.  

When a Chunk of Ancient Debris is smelted, it will output a Netherite Scrap.  
9 Chunks of Ancient Debris can be crafted together making a new block called **Block of Ancient Debris Chunks**, which can be uncrafted back into the 9 Chunks of Ancient Debris.  

The Netherite Ingot recipe has been updated to use 5 Netherite Scraps, instead of 4 as Fortune makes Ancient Debris more common.
